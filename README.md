# SimpleKeplerOrbits
Unity3d plugin project for creating objects, moving on eliptic or hyperbolic curves around other objects. 
Curves settings set by attractor parameters (mass, GConst) and velocity vector of body, 
which makes this system useful in simulation of celestial mechanics in games.

This system doesn't support N-body simulation, only 2-body analytic solution for simplisity.
